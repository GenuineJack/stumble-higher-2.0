Deploy tips
===========

1. Drop ALL files in this folder onto Vercel / Netlify as a **static site**.
   • No build step needed – it's pure HTML + JS.

2. After deployment, copy your public frame URL:

   https://YOUR‑DOMAIN/frame.html

   Replace **FRAME_URL_PLACEHOLDER** in index.html with that URL
   (or do a quick search‑and‑replace BEFORE uploading).

3. Upload again (or edit in the dashboard) so the meta tag points to
   the correct HTTPS frame URL.

4. Cast the root link (index.html) in Warpcast to see the 3:2 cover +
   “Start Stumbling” button. Enjoy!
